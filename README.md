# bubblepointtemperature
This MATLAB code uses the Non-Random Two-Liquid Model activity coefficient correlation for the liquid phase and the Peng Robinson Equation of State for the vapor phase to predict the bubble point temperature of a binary mixture of Cyclohexane(C6H12) and Tert-Butanol(C4H10O) at 1 atm pressure.
